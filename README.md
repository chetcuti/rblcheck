RBL Checker
-----------
Rename check.domains-sample to check.domains, and rename check.ips-sample to check.ips. Edit the new files, updating them with the domains and IP addresses that you want to check the RBLs for.

(Optional) Edit rbls.domains and rbls.ips, adding any additional RBLs you want to check.
